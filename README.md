# OpenCFE

OpenCFE (Open Source CANbus Function Extender) is a free hardware and software package designed to enhance the functionality of your Volvo by reading and sending messages on its CANbus network.

Feature availibility depends on platform and model year, but examples include:

- Raise windows and close sunroof when locked by key fob
- Automatically enable heated seats in cold temperatures
- Welcome and goodbye messages on DIM LCD
- Gauge sweep at ignition on

OpenCFE was designed to add this functionality in a way that upholds the ideas of open source software/hardware, since previous commercial products with similar goals have limited what the Volvo community can gain by making the research, hardware, and software behind them private.
